## About

The neon lights still flicker, rain lies heavy on the asphalt, and your editor wakes up with you.  
**Night City** is a VS Code theme for long nights, short sleep, and code that lives in the glow of neon colors.  
Cool darkness, sharp contrasts, and synthetic accents straight into your workflow.

**Keywords** shine like neon signs above the streets,  
**Comments** fade into the haze of steaming sewers,  
**Strings** cut through the noise - precise, calm, uncompromising.

## Features

- **Carefully crafted color palette** with cyberpunk aesthetics 
- **Easy on the eyes** for those long coding sessions
- **High contrast** where it matters, subtle where it doesn't
- **Neon accents** that make your syntax pop
- **Full UI integration** - not just editor colors
- **Optimized for modern languages** - JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, and more

## Who is this for?

Cut out the noise. Crank up the contrast.  
**Welcome to Night City.**

> Found a glitch? Wouldnt suprise me. This repository contains 20% logic, 30% caffeine and 50% "why does this suddenly work?"  
> It works on my machine and thats what matters. (I hope someone finds the "Militech" Easter Egg in this Theme.)

I especially recommend these Guides if you would like to design youre own VSCTheme:

- [Theme Authoring Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-capabilities/theming)
- [Theme Color Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color)

But there are also really good Tutorials if you dont like reading.
